### Hi there and Welcome! 👋👋👋

#### About :rabbit2:
MX Linux team member, mostly application packaging, and small fixes here and there.  I've always been a huge proponent of FOSS and donated :moneybag: to ones I used.  I only started doing any of this because I wanted something specific packaged and got ~~duped~~ into learning how to do it myself.  Somehow, it turned into freshly packaging or backporting all kinds of things, even creating some things for the MX Community.  I'm far from an expert at any of it, but always willing to share what I know, and always eager to learn new things.
